# Inspiration  
We’ve always been fascinated by **steganography**—hiding secrets inside files—and by the rise of **voice agents**. That got us thinking: could we use the human voice as a natural, almost invisible key to lock down e-commerce checkouts?  

E-commerce merchants lose billions to fraud every year. In 2023, global online payment fraud losses were over **$48 billion**, with account takeover fraud alone hitting **$11.4 billion**.  

We wanted to create a **lock that feels frictionless to real people but impossible for fraudsters**.  

Fun fact: we named this project after our favorite bar and grill in San Francisco, **Balboa Cafe**. It’s where I first met my teammate, and we just reunited at HackHarvard — hence the domain name **balboa.vodka**.

# What it does  
Balboa is a **voice-based cognitive lock** for online checkout.  
- When a transaction looks risky, instead of clunky 2FA, the shopper just speaks a secret phrase.  
- Balboa verifies three things:  
  1. The **secret phrase** matches.  
  2. The **voice embedding similarity** holds true.  
  3. *(Optional)* A **cryptographic audio fingerprint** matches the original wav file.  

To the customer, it’s quick and natural. To bots and fraud rings, it’s a brick wall.

# How we built it  
We stitched together tools we love:  
- **Gemini API** to guide users through onboarding and capture “voice secrets.”  
- **ElevenLabs** for natural voice interactions.  
- A custom **cryptographic audio fingerprint**, borrowing ideas from steganography.  

We integrated Balboa into a **Medusa.js / Vercel demo store**, where it only triggers if the fraud model flags a checkout as high risk.

# Challenges we ran into  
- Balancing **security vs. friction**.  
- Making **voice embeddings** fast and accurate enough for checkout.  
- Prototyping **client-side audio fingerprinting** without heavy libraries.  

---

# Accomplishments that we're proud of  
- A working demo checkout where Balboa kicks in only on high-risk flows.  
- Real-time integration of **voice secrets + embeddings**.  
- A security layer that feels **invisible** to real customers.  

---

# What we learned  
- Voice biometrics actually work in checkout flows if you pair them with fraud scoring.  
- People are more willing to engage with security if it feels **natural**.  
- Cryptographic fingerprints can outperform traditional browser fingerprinting.

# What's next for Balboa  
- **Deeper OEM cryptographic fingerprinting** — partnering with device makers to embed tamper-resistant, device-backed anchors.  
- Expansion to more e-commerce platforms.  
- Exploring **continuous authentication** beyond checkout.  
- Optimizing latency until Balboa feels instant.
